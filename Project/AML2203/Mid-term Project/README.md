# Data Analysis on Ischaemic Heart Disease

Data analysis on trends/patterns on the death rate of Ischaemic Heart Disease for each income group and gender over the last few years (1950-2020). In addition, a model was developed, trained and tested to get the probability of a particular record to fall into a particular age category. Logistic Regression for model creation.

The datasets are taken from the following sources
-	[WHO's interactive platform for mortality data](https://platform.who.int/mortality/themes/theme-details/topics/indicator-groups/indicator-group-details/MDB/ischaemic-heart-disease)
-	[WHO methods and data sources of country-level causes of death (p. 49)](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/gho-documents/global-health-estimates/ghe2019_cod_methods.pdf)
